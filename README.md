# Ludum Dare 39 + LOWREZJAM 2018 | UNLOCKR

> My entry for Ludum Dare 42 + LOWREZJAM2018, made with Phaser + TypeScript.

_Theme: **Running Out Of Space**_

**UNLOCKR** is some sorta infinite runner for claustrophobic people: you're locked inside a corridor and the wall behind you is closing in, the only "exit" is to unlock whatever door that appears before you so you don't get crushed.

...

Oh...well, looks like we ran out of equipment! BUT we do have a prototype pack you can **JUST USE**, save for the fact that the plasma tank might be leaking a little bit so you'll have to rugh, but I don't think it's a problem, right? Nice! :smile:

And to you, there, looking at us right now. Yeah, **YOU** on the chair! To help us test this stuff here you'll have to use your mouse + keyboard or an X360 controller (no endorsements here).

That's it! We're counting on you! Our bots won't hurt you (too much), but don't die in there!
