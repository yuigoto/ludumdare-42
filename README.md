LD42 + LOWREZJAM : UNLOCKR
==========================

> My entry for Ludum Dare 42 + LOWREZJAM2018, made with Phaser + TypeScript.

The Game
--------

**UNLOCKR** is some sorta infinite runner for claustrophobic people: you're locked inside a corridor and the wall behind you is closing in, the only "exit" is to unlock whatever door that appears before you so you don't get crushed.

- Graphics done in **Aseprite**;
- Sound effects recorded in an **iPad 2**, with **Rectools08**;
- **FL Studio** was used for both sound design and music sequencing;
- Written in **TypeScript** + **Phaser CE**, using **JetBrains WebStorm**.

Game design, graphics, audio and code by **Fabio Y. Goto**.

### Controls

- Use **Left or Right** to turn the dial;
